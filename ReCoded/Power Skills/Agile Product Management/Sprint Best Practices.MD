# Sprint Best Practices Notes

## Define the next sprint's goal

- Define goals like what user actually gains: "Users will be able to accomplish _something_"

- This type of goals come with clear understanding of what the team is going to achive in that sprint.

- The sprint should point to only the outcome that users will gain out of it.

- The authors summary
  - (1) The product owner presents the sprint backlog and describes the next increment that they want the team to deliver.
  - (2) The team understands their capacity.
  - (3) The team breaks stories into sub-tasks. Gives hourly estimates to sub-tasks and issues they have included in the sprint.
  - (4) Everyone looks to the goals again, adjusts to the work they have taken, and commits to the goal.
