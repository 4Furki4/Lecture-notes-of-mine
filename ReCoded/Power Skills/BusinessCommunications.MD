# Business Communications

## Formatting Email

### Caveats

- I should not use emoticons in my business email
- I should use email adresses that just contain my name and surname
- I should not rush to write emails !

### Structure

- Greetings or salutaion is how I should greet my reader.
  - The rule is simple: Dear [title] [last name] or [title] [first name]
  - Hello/hi [title] [last name] may be used.
  - if I don't know who I'm adressing, I can use __"To Whom It May Concern"__

- Then body part:
  - Paragraphs and sentence lengths should tend to be short.
  - I should be direct to the reader, BE CONCISE !
  - Uppercases should be used carefully and as less as possible.

- Signature part that contains some sentences like best regards, sincerely and so on.

## Business Calls

### Do's and Don'ts

- DO prepare for my call as I do for my emails !
- DO find a quite place
- DO INTRODUCE YOUSELF !
- Do state your reason for the call.
- DON'T CAUGHT UP for the minor details unless asked for
