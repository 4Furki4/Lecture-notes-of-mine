# Elevator Pitch

- It's a brief, efficient summary of my skills, experience and what I can offer.

- It is called as Elevator Pitch because it should be so short that the speak should be done within an elevator's reach time

## Elevator Pitch Guidelines

### Start With a Hook

- Hi, I'm Furkan and have been learning web development by myself for a year. I dropped out my university at first year after I decided to be web developer.

### Describe What You Do

- I started with back-end and then I realized that I love creating client-side apps as well. I'm currently taking bootcamp by Recoded to take my front-end skills to the next level.

### Highlight Your Unique Value Proposition

- Even if I generally work alone, I really do love being part of a team, and help people especially who are newbies, and need to find out how to learn.
I love to stretch my borders, taking risk and team members that force my borders by asking questions and pushing me to learn new things by assigning me new tasks.

### Provide Evidence

- For instance, I'm a volunteer at Kodluyoruz which is the biggest programming community in Turkey and help people to learn how to learn. Also, I helped many people during bootcamp by ReCoded.

### End With a Call To Action

- Talking with new people tought me many things and, I'd like to have talk with you, may be about the dictionary project, if you want !

PROJECT YOU FORGOT

Hi, My name is Furkan and have been learning web development by myself for a year. I have no degree at all, dropped out the school and just believed in myself that I can learn web development and find a job without a degree. I speciliazed myself in backend first and made my first API trials for my dream project using .NET. I'm currently taking Recoded bootcamp which quite enhances my soft skills like teamworkig and self learning and front-end skills. During the bootcamp, I realized that I do really love being part of a team, taking risk, encouraging, helping and leading my teammates. Not only do I love to help my teammates, I also love to help newbies as a volunteer at Kodluyoruz. What I eagerly learnt so far is .Net API, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript and Angular. We're about to learn React as well in bootcamp. I'm eager to get in touch with you as well !
