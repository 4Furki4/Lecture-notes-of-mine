# Elevator Pitch

- It's a brief, efficient summary of my skills, experience and what I can offer.

- It is called as Elevator Pitch because it should be so short that the speak should be done within an elevator's reach time

## Elevator Pitch Guidelines

### Start With a Hook

- Hi, I'm Furkan and I love learning web development by myself. I dropped out my university after I decided to be web developer even if I didn't know what I would go through.

### Describe What You Do

-I started with back-end and then I realized that I love creating client-side apps as well. What I'm currently working on is that building a new online Turkish dictionary.

### Highlight Your Unique Value Proposition

- Even if I generally work alone, I really do love being part of a team, and help people especially who are newbies, and need to find out how to learn. I love to stretch my borders, taking risk and team members that force my borders by asking questions and pushing me to learn new things by assigning me new tasks.

### Provide Evidence

- For instance, I'm a volunteer at Kodluyoruz which is the biggest programming community in Turkey and help people to learn how to learn. Also, I helped many people during bootcamp by ReCoded.

### End With a Call To Action

- Talking with new people tought me many things and, I'd like to have talk with you, may be about the dictionary project, if you want !
