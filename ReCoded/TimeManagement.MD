# Time Management - ReCoded

## PART - I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME

### What's distracting me ?

- [ ] Politics, News

- [ ] I'm not prioritizing my tasks.

- [ ] I keep checking if I have messages, notifications on my phone and discord which distracts me a lot !

- [ ] I'm not planning what to do, just doing instinctively.

- [ ] I promise to help people which is not helpful me, quite the contrary burderns me with responsibility a lot.
