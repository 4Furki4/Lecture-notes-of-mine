# CSS Notes

- Notes that are taken during Recoded bootcamp. I'll take notes of what I don't know about css, not the whole.

## Combining Selectors

### Various Selectors Without Space Between Them

````css
selector-1selector-2{
    ...
}

````

- It selects the elemet(s) that has/have the given combination

- Examples

````css
h1.main-page{
    ...
}

#big-blue.large.blue{
    ...
}

````

### Ancestor and Child With Space Between Them

````css
ancestor child{
    ...
}
````

- It selects all children that the given ancestor is their ancestor. Ancestor doesn't need to be a direct parent of the given child.

````css
div p {
    Selects all p elements in divs
}
````

- This can be combined the previous combination

````css
header.main-header h1.brown{
    Selects all h1 elemets that has brown class in header element that has main-header class.
}
````

### Avoid Duplication

- You can avoid duplication using , between selectors that implies same properties

````cs
.big{
    font-size: 200%;
}
.large{
    font-size: 200%;
}
//to avoid duplaction, use this:
.big, .large{
    font-size: 200%;
}
````

### Asterisk * Selector

- It refers to everything and used to set default properties.

````css
* {
    font-family: ...
}
````
